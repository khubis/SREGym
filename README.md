<h2 id="overview">🔍 Overview</h2>
SREGym is an AI-native platform to enable the design, development, and evaluation of AI agents for Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). The core idea is to create live system environments for SRE agents to solve real-world SRE problems. SREGym provides a comprehensive SRE benchmark suite with a wide variety of problems for evaluating SRE agents and also for training next-generation AI agents.
<br><br>

![SREGym Overview](/assets/overview.png)

SREGym is inspired by our prior work on AIOpsLab and ITBench. It is architectured with AI-native usability and extensibility as first-class principles. The SREGym benchmark suites contain 90 different SRE problems. It supports all the problems from AIOpsLab and ITBench, and includes new problems such as OS-level faults, metastable failures, and concurrent failures. See our [problem set](https://sregym.com/problems) for a complete list of problems.

SREGym has been used to simulate real-world cloud failures, such as:
- Cloudflare WAF regex rules exhausted CPU ([postmortem](https://blog.cloudflare.com/details-of-the-cloudflare-outage-on-july-2-2019), [simulation](https://github.com/SREGym/SREGym/pull/773))
- Admission webhook TLS mismatch ([postmortem](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/6350), [simulation](https://github.com/SREGym/SREGym/pull/777))
- Exhausting conntrack table space crippled a production cluster ([postmortem](https://www.markbetz.net/2023/12/12/exhausting-conntrack-table-space-crippled-our-k8s-cluster), [simulation](https://github.com/SREGym/SREGym/pull/768))
- GKE ran out of IP addresses ([postmortem](https://deploy.live/blog/when-gke-ran-out-of-ip-addresses), [simulation](https://github.com/SREGym/SREGym/pull/774))
- Kafka poison pill ([postmortem](https://www.lydtechconsulting.com/blog/kafka-poison-pill), [simulation](https://github.com/SREGym/SREGym/pull/790))
- The Reddit Pi-Day Outage ([postmortem](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/11xx5o0/you_broke_reddit_the_piday_outage/), [simulation](https://github.com/SREGym/SREGym/pull/828))

<h2 id="🚀SREGym-Lite">🚀🚀🚀 Start with SREGym-Lite</h2>

[SREGym-Lite](./docs/SREGym-Lite.md) is a curated set of 21 representative problems with varied difficulty levels that are friendly to run. It is the recommended starting point for new users and can run easily on a [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) setup with 8 vCPU and 16 GB of memory.

### Splunk-adapted Assistant V3 Lite pilot (this fork)

This fork can ingest a Lite case into Splunk, invoke a separately running
LangChain Deep Agents Assistant V3 server, verify representative telemetry,
and package its answer, judge score, and trace. The upstream quickstart below
uses a different, native-observability workflow.

1. Complete the [Splunk Lite setup](./docs/assistant-v3-lite-repeat.md): a Ready
   Kind cluster, prebuilt agent image, a running Assistant V3 connected to the
   same Splunk org, and a private copy of the
   [runner environment template](./.env.splunk-lite.example) at `.env.splunk-lite`
   and [Assistant server template](./.env.assistant-v3-splunk.example) in the
   separate Assistant checkout. The setup includes an embedding preflight:
   use current Assistant `main`, where semantic memory follows V3's gateway
   configuration, and a dedicated memory database compatible with the selected
   embedding model. No separate embedding-routing patch is required.
2. From this SREGym checkout, run one case with one command:

   ```bash
   uv run --env-file .env.splunk-lite --no-sync python -m sregym.results.assistant_v3_lite_repeat run --credentials synthetic --problem cronjob_sidecar_blocks_completion_hotel_reservation --output results/reproductions/cronjob-smoke
   ```

   Or run all 21 Lite cases sequentially:

   ```bash
   uv run --env-file .env.splunk-lite --no-sync python -m sregym.results.assistant_v3_lite_repeat run --credentials synthetic --output results/reproductions/lite-21
   ```

   Repeat the same command and output folder to resume. Open `summary.md`
   under that output folder for scores and links to case artifacts.

The `svelte`, symptom-guided Splunk pilot is **not leaderboard-comparable**.
The one-line command runs the evaluation after setup; it does not provision
Kind, Splunk, or the separately running Assistant server.

<h2 id="🚀quickstart">🚀 Quickstart</h2>

## Setup your cluster
Choose either a) or b) to set up your cluster and then proceed to the next steps.

### a) Kubernetes Cluster (Recommended)
SREGym runs on a self-managed Kubernetes cluster that you provision on Linux hosts you have SSH and root access to (e.g. [CloudLab](https://www.cloudlab.us/), bare-metal machines, or cloud VMs/VPS instances). We provide an Ansible playbook that builds the cluster for you. Follow this [README](./scripts/ansible/README.md) to set it up.

> [!NOTE]
> A managed Kubernetes service won't work out of the box, since SREGym's setup needs SSH and root access to the nodes for OS-level cluster configuration. Instead, spin up a few plain VMs/VPS instances and add them to `inventory.yml`.

### b) Emulated cluster
SREGym can be run on an emulated cluster using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) on your local machine. However, not all problems are supported.

**Note:** If you run into pod crashes or "too many open files" errors, see the [kind README](./kind/README.md) for required host kernel settings and troubleshooting.

```bash
bash kind/setup_kind_cluster.sh
```

For existing clusters, see the [upgrade and baseline instructions](./docs/network-access.md#cluster-maintenance).

<h2 id="⚙️usage">⚙️ Usage</h2>

### Running an Agent

#### Quick Start

To get started with the included Stratus agent:

1. Set your LLM API keys in the environment (required for your chosen model provider):
```bash
# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."

# Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Google
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."

# AWS Bedrock
export AWS_PROFILE="bedrock"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-2"
```

2. Run the full benchmark:
```bash
uv run main.py --agent stratus --model gpt-5
```

Or start with SREGym-Lite:
```bash
uv run main.py --suite sregym-lite --agent stratus --model gpt-5
```

Use `--judge-model` to override the judge model separately (defaults to `--model`):
```bash
uv run main.py --agent stratus --model gpt-5 --judge-model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6-20250627
```

#### Stage Selection

Each problem runs up to two agent stages, `diagnosis` then `mitigation`. By default a
run attempts every stage the problem supports. `--stages` narrows that:

```bash
# Diagnose only; never enter the mitigation stage
uv run main.py --problem network_policy_block --stages diagnosis

# Both, stated explicitly (the default)
uv run main.py --suite sregym-lite --stages diagnosis mitigation
```

`--stages` is independent of `--problem` and `--suite`: the stages decide what an
attempt does, the problem selection decides which problems it does it to. Stages must
be given in the order above.

Useful mainly when iterating on a problem's diagnosis oracle, where a mitigation
attempt is wasted time — note that `--agent-timeout` is a budget for the whole agent
phase, so a slow diagnosis otherwise eats into mitigation's share.

> [!NOTE]
> A single-stage run is reported as `complete`, since completeness is measured against
> the stages that were configured. It is not, however, useful input to
> `sregym/results/report.py`'s difficulty tables, which treat a missing mitigation
> result as inconclusive.

Naming a stage the problem has no oracle for is an error rather than a silent skip, so
a typo cannot produce a run that reports success having measured nothing.

#### Container Isolation

Agents always run in isolated Docker containers, preventing access to SREGym internals like problem definitions and grading logic. The image is built automatically on first run.

Use `--force-build` to rebuild the container image after updating dependencies or agent code:

```bash
uv run main.py --agent codex --model gpt-5 --force-build
```

#### Network access

Filtered access is the default. Agents can reach the selected model provider and internal services, but not other internet destinations.
Application pods also have outbound restrictions.

Use `--internet-access open` for unrestricted internet access.
To allow an extra destination in filtered mode, add `--allow-agent-endpoint`:

```bash
uv run main.py --agent codex --model gpt-5.6-sol \
  --allow-agent-endpoint https://telemetry.example.com/v1
```

Repeat the option for more destinations.

Agent containers are hardened by default: every Linux capability is dropped except `DAC_OVERRIDE`, which container
root needs to write to the host-owned `/logs` and `/workspace` bind mounts, and `no-new-privileges` is set. This
blocks `apt-get`, which cannot drop to the `_apt` user without `setuid`/`setgid`. If your agent installs tooling
during a run, turn it off:

```bash
uv run main.py --agent codex --model gpt-5 --container-hardening off
```

#### Optional Jev decision support

Jev is disabled by default. To enable it for Codex, set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` and run:

```bash
uv run main.py --agent codex --model gpt-5.6-luna --reasoning-effort medium \
  --problem <problem-id> --jev-model jev-latest --force-build
```

Jev reviews diagnostic tests and submissions using evidence sent to TypeSafe.

### Deployment Profiles

`--profile` controls how much infrastructure SREGym stands up. It is independent of
`--suite` — the profile selects *what gets deployed*, the suite selects *which problems run*.

| Profile | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| `full` (default) | The standard stack. Use this for results you intend to compare against the leaderboard. |
| `svelte` | Additionally drops components that nothing in SREGym reads, and shortens metric retention. |

```bash
uv run main.py --suite sregym-lite --agent stratus --model gpt-5 --profile svelte
```

`svelte` removes:

- astronomy-shop's bundled **OpenSearch**, **Grafana** and **Jaeger**. Nothing in `sregym/`,
  `mcp_server/` or `clients/` queries OpenSearch or Grafana; the bundled Jaeger is deleted
  moments after deployment anyway, by `Jaeger.create_external_name_service()`.
- Prometheus **Alertmanager** and **Pushgateway** (no alert rules are configured and nothing
  pushes), and TSDB retention cut from 15d to 2h.
- The OpenEBS **node-disk-manager** stack, which backs the `openebs-device` StorageClass.
  SREGym only provisions through `openebs-hostpath`.

Measured on one astronomy-shop problem (peak RSS / peak CPU, sampled over the run):

| | `full` | `svelte` |
|---|---|---|
| OpenSearch | 1096 MiB / 1709m | — |
| Grafana | 475 MiB / 303m | — |
| OpenEBS NDM (7 pods) | ~190 MiB / 582m | — |

> [!WARNING]
> `svelte` changes what an agent can observe in the cluster, so its scores are **not**
> comparable with `full`. It is intended for local iteration on memory-constrained hosts,
> not for leaderboard submissions. Note that `--profile svelte` and `--suite sregym-lite`
> are unrelated: you can run either without the other.

### Model Selection

SREGym uses [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) model strings directly (no config file needed). Just pass any supported model string via `--model`:

| CLI Flag | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `--model` | `gpt-5` | Sets both agent and judge model |
| `--judge-model` | (same as `--model`) | Override just the judge evaluator model |
| `--judge-backend` | `api` | Judge access through the existing API endpoint, or `codex`, `claudecode`, `copilot`, or `cursor` |

Set the required environment variable for your provider before running:

| Provider | Model String Examples | Required Environment Variables |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| OpenAI | `gpt-5`, `gpt-4o` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Anthropic | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6-20250627` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Google | `gemini/gemini-2.5-pro` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| AWS Bedrock | `bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0` | `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` |
| Azure | `azure/gpt-4o` | `AZURE_API_KEY`, `AZURE_API_BASE`, `AZURE_API_VERSION` |

#### Local LLMs

SREGym supports local models through Ollama and OpenAI-compatible servers such as vLLM and LM Studio. The examples below use Ollama.

Set `AGENT_API_KEY` as well if the endpoint requires authentication.

> [!CAUTION]
> When you use `--internet-access filtered`, the agent runs on an isolated Docker network. It cannot reach a local model server that listens only on `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. Configure the server to listen on a host-reachable interface, such as `0.0.0.0`, and use `http://host.docker.internal:<port>` as the API base. Protect the exposed port with authentication or a firewall. This requirement is the same for Kind and external Kubernetes clusters because the connection is between the agent container and the machine running SREGym.

**Stratus with Ollama:**

```bash
ollama pull qwen3-coder:30b

export AGENT_API_BASE="http://127.0.0.1:11434"
uv run main.py --agent stratus --model ollama_chat/qwen3-coder:30b
```

**OpenCode with Ollama:**

OpenCode uses the endpoint's OpenAI-compatible `/v1` API.

```bash
export AGENT_API_BASE="http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1"
uv run main.py --agent opencode --model local/qwen3-coder:30b
```

When `--judge-model` is not set, SREGym reuses the agent model and endpoint for the judge. This works directly for Stratus because its model identifier is LiteLLM-compatible. For OpenCode, SREGym normalizes `local/<served-model>` to `openai/<served-model>` for the judge, because OpenCode's `local/` provider uses an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

For vLLM, LM Studio, or another OpenAI-compatible server, point `AGENT_API_BASE` to its `/v1` endpoint and use `openai/<served-model>` with Stratus or `local/<served-model>` with OpenCode.

To use a different LiteLLM judge provider, pass `--judge-model` explicitly:

```bash
export JUDGE_API_BASE="http://127.0.0.1:11434"
uv run main.py --agent opencode --model local/qwen3-coder:30b --judge-model ollama_chat/qwen3-coder:30b
```

**Separate judge endpoint:**

Set `JUDGE_API_BASE` and `JUDGE_API_KEY` when the judge uses a different endpoint or credential:

```bash
export JUDGE_API_BASE="https://example.test/v1"
export JUDGE_API_KEY="..."
uv run main.py --agent stratus --model ollama_chat/qwen3-coder:30b --judge-model gpt-5
```

### Subscription-backed judges

Choose a subscription judge independently of the agent with `--judge-backend` (default `api`).

```bash
uv run main.py --agent cursor --model auto --judge-backend codex --judge-model gpt-5.5
```

| Judge backend | Credentials |
| --- | --- |
| `codex` | Subscription login in `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, default `~/.codex/auth.json` |
| `claudecode` | `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` |
| `copilot` | `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `cursor` | `CURSOR_API_KEY` |

Set `--judge-model` to a model supported by the selected CLI.

For Copilot, use `export COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"` to reuse an existing GitHub CLI OAuth login.
