# Splunk-visible ground truth and limits

This is an evidence assessment, **not** a separately graded Splunk-visible numeric score.
The pre-agent check ran before V3 and does not use the oracle to guide its prompt.

- Incident window: 2026-09-28T00:08:47.950585Z through 2026-09-28T00:10:49.140327Z UTC
- Pre-agent status: `confirmed`; visibility: `fully_splunk_observable`
- Evidence: The same new frontend pod has the non-cluster DNS policy and an external-only resolver.
- Access gap: None established by this check.
- Remedy: No additional access remedy specified.

## Independent post-grade audit

No separate post-grade golden-telemetry API audit was saved for this attempt. Use the [pre-agent proof](pre_agent_proof.json); do not treat it as exhaustive parity.
